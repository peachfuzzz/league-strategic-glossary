The weighted average of an outcome. The expected value of an outcome is directly proportional to the probability of the potential value gained. Expected value is a strong factor in decision-making, and optimization often surrounds improving the expected value of decisions by either lowering the variance of success or increasing the value of the outcome. 
Authors’ note: We avoid using standard deviation because it is uncommon in the player lexicon and implies a level of precision impossible to measure.
