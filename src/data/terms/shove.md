Killing all the minions in a wave as fast as possible. Shoving is a short-term wave tactic primarily used when a player has a short window for manipulating a wave, but cannot be responded to by the opponent. During the lane phase, the goal of shoving is to crash a wave into the opposing tower completely. Outside of the laning phase, shoving refers to the general act of pushing a wave as quickly as possible.
