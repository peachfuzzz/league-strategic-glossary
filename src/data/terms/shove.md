Killing all the minions in a wave as fast as possible. Shoving is a short-term wave tactic primarily used when a player has a short window for manipulating a wave, but cannot be responded to by the opponent. During the lane phase, the goal of shoving is to crash a wave into the opposing tower completely. Outside of the laning phase, shoving refers to the general act of pushing a wave as quickly as possible.

Shoving is commonly performed immediately after a player kills their lane opponent. By pushing their wave into the opposing tower, the player forces their lane opponent to miss the gold and experience of any minions killed by the tower while minimizing any gold or experience lost from their own recall.
