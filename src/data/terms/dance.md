An extended sequence between two teams around a neutral objective where both teams hesitate to commit against each other. Dances tend to happen when both teams are roughly equal in strength and the objective in question is particularly important, such as baron, dragon soul, or elder dragon. Baron and dragon dances are some of the most tense sequences in a game, since the stakes are game-deciding and the inevitable fight is chaotic.
