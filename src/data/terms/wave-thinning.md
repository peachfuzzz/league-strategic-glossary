Killing a few minions in an incoming wave without clearing it entirely. Thinning a wave is used to slow down a push or lower the possible incoming minion damage. Generally, the goal of thinning is to kills as few minions as necessary to preserve the wave direction while slowing the wave’s speed. Commonly performed to maintain a freeze.
