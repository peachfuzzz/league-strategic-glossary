Killing a few minions in an incoming wave without eliminating the entire wave. Thinning a wave is used to slow down a push or lower the possible incoming minion damage. Successfully thinning a wave preserves the wave direction while slowing the wave’s speed and the damage taken from minions. Commonly performed to maintain a freeze, contest a crash, or stall a dive.
