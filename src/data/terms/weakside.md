A lane that receives comparatively fewer roams and ganks from their teammates. Designating a lane as a team’s weakside (weaksiding) incentivizes the weaksided player to play more cautiously, since they are less likely to receive assistance against enemy plays. A weakside is the cost of a strongside: investing heavily in one lane means leaving another to fend for themselves.
