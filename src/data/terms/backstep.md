Dodging an ability by briefly moving opposite the expected direction of travel. Backsteps are effectively a subclass of sidesteps that travel backwards. A backstep requires a player to input a movement command in the opposite direction of their original intended location, thus requiring a higher degree of intentionality than a traditional sidestep.
