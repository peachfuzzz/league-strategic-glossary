The abstract evaluation of the favorability of outcomes for specific champions during the lane phase or an isolated combat. Matchups ar the total of the possible interactions that result in one or more champions holding advantages or disadvantages over the other(s), assuming equal champion mastery and skill between each player. Analysis of matchups can concern players in a single role, or a combination of two roles (such as bot/support or mid/jungle), but rarely the entire draft.

Matchups in League are not clearly quantified due to the multitude of factors that can create variance. Qualifiers are often attached to describe the general favorability of interactions. Matchups are judged on a scale from hard winning to hard losing, with matchups in the middle deemed “skill” or “even.” Truly unplayable matchups are extremely rare in League due to how many factors can influence the isolated 1v1.
