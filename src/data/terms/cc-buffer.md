Casting an ability immediately before falling under hard crowd control to overlap moments of inactionability. Most abilities are uncancelable and have an animation during which a champion is inactionable. A player can time the cast of an ability to begin right before hard CC is applied, which results in the CC duration sharing significant overlap with the champion’s existing animation inactionability. 

A special case exists for some movement abilities with startup animations. When an immobilizing or displacing effect hits a champion during or immediately before the startup of their dash or blink, the startup animation of the movement is not interrupted, letting the dash succeed regardless.

Authors’ note: The term “buffer” sometimes applies to this phenomenon, but we have separated the definitions for clarity.
