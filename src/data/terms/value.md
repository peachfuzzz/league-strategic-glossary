The quantitative measurement of an action, decision, or state. In essence, value is how much something is “worth” to an actor. An outcome’s value is its measurable quantity: gold, health, mana, cooldown, movement, etc. Value allows for comparing actions or decisions that are measured similarly. Analogous to money in real life, value is discounted over time: a given amount of value now is worth more than the same amount of value later.
