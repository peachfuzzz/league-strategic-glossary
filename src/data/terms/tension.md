A state of raised stakes, especially with respect to the opposing team. Tension appears when two competing interests from opposing parties collide, even without active threat or combat. The presence of tension accentuates losses and gains—for each interest fulfilled by one side, an equivalent interest is lost for the other. Tension scales with both threat and value. The greater the potential agency each side has over the other or the greater the value of the outcome, the higher the stakes rise.
