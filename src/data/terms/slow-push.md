Killing minions as slowly as possible while an actor’s wave pushes toward the enemy tower. Slow pushing is a medium-term wave tactic primarily used when a player has a longer window for manipulating a wave. Slow pushing is a common default tactic because minions naturally tend to slow push if left mostly undisturbed. Slow pushes happen over 2-4 waves and result in a large buildup of allied minions before eventually crashing. The eventual large crash gives the actor a timer to make a bigger play, such as a dive, a roam, or a recall.
