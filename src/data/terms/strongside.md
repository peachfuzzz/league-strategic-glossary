A lane that receives comparatively more roams and ganks from their teammates. Designating a lane as a team’s strongside (strongsiding) incentivizes the strongsided player to play more aggressively, since they are more likely to receive assistance with their plays. Strongsiding can help swing a volatile matchup or snowball an already advantaged lane at the cost of creating a weakside.
