The act of resetting a champion’s basic attack timer *after* damage occurs with a different input. If an attack is reset after the attack’s damage is applied, it starts the next attack’s windup immediately, letting another attack start sooner than usual. The term “attack reset” can also refer to the specific action that triggers an attack reset. Most abilities that empower a champion’s basic attack also serve as attack resets. Attack resets are often a key part of a champion’s bread-and-butter string. 
Authors’ note: Sometimes used interchangeably with attack cancels, but we separated the two mechanics for increased clarity.
