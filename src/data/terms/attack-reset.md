The act of resetting a champion’s basic attack timer *after* damage occurs with a different input. If an attack is reset after the attack’s damage is applied, it starts the next attack’s windup immediately, letting another attack start sooner than usual. Most abilities that empower a champion’s basic attack also serve as attack resets. Attack resets are often a key part of a champion’s bread-and-butter string. The specific ability or item that lets a champion attack reset can also be referred to as an attack reset.
Authors’ note: Sometimes used interchangeably with attack cancels, but we separated the two mechanics for increased clarity.
