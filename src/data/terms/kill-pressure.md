Kill pressure is a state where a player can kill another player with any of their strings of abilities. Usually, this means that if the player with kill pressure lands their key set up ability, they have a string of inputs that takes a relatively short amount of time that has a high likelihood of killing the other player. Whenever a player has kill pressure, it allows them to play much more aggressively, and the defending player will need to play more safely.
