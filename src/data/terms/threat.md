Threat is the potential to act on an object in combat. It is generated when an actor obtains the capability to influence a target by creating value, and increases with the probability of a successful action. Fundamentally, threat is speculative—the threat of an action can create value on its own, but any value generated is with reference to an implied ground state. 

Example: Blitzcrank approaches an enemy champion with its Q, Rocket Grab. While Blitz Q is off cooldown, Blitz has extremely high potential to act upon its target since its hook repositions the enemy and renders them temporarily inactionable. This means while Blitz can cast its hook, it generates massive threat. Blitz can use the threat of the hook—the possibility for the hook to hit its target—as a way to influence the enemy. However, if Blitz never casts the hook, the possible value is never realized, since it never acts upon the enemy.
