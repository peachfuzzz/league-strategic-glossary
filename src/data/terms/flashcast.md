Casting Flash during the cast time of an ability. The effect of a flashcast varies with how an ability is implemented. Whether an ability is aimed at the start or end of its cast time, whether it originates from the character at the beginning or end of its cast time, and its targeting input method all affect the outcome of a successful flashcast. Not all abilities can be flashcast.
