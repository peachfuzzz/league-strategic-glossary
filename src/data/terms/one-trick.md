Refers to a player who plays almost exclusively a single champion. The player may play the same champion in multiple roles, but rarely deviates from their main unless banned out. High elo one-tricks are a common source of specific champion innovation. Watching a champion’s associated one-tricks play in high elo is also a common suggestion to players new to a champion. Originates from the phrase “one-trick pony.”
