Keeping a larger enemy minion wave near, but not within range of, an allied tower. A freeze forms when a large enemy wave can kill an allied wave before the allied minions can build up fast enough to reverse wave direction, while also not being allowed to crash into the allied tower. Freezing can allow an actor to deny the opposing laner(s) of minion gold or even experience for an extended period of time, since the wave will not initiate a bounceback until the freeze is broken. A freeze breaks when the enemy minions cannot kill enough allied minions to prevent a buildup, and can happen intentionally or naturally. Within a large enough difference of ranged minions (usually 3+), a freeze can last indefinitely, sometimes referred to as a true freeze.
