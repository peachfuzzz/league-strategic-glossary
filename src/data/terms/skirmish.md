A medium-scale fight involving multiple players from both teams. Skirmishes are a catch-all term for fights which are too small to be considered a teamfight, but involve more players than in a duel. Skirmishes tend to favor champions who have significant sustained damage but suffer heavily from the hard lockdown and burst present in full teamfights.
