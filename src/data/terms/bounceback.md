The phase of a minion wave that occurs after a wave crashes into the opposing team’s tower. During a bounceback, the opposing minions will outnumber the allied minions, forcing the wave to push back towards the allied tower. Bouncebacks are a period of higher tension during the lane phase because a death from either side results in more lost minions than an even wave. Bouncebacks can result in a freeze.
