A string of all of a champion’s basic abilities. Most champions in League are designed to use their abilities in tandem for greater value. Abilities in a champion’s kit usually have differing cooldowns so an ability rotation is easiest to perform at the beginning of a fight. A full rotation of abilities becomes more difficult to perform as fights extend and the opportunity cost of holding spells increases.
