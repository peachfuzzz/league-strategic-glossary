All-in✓
See also: trade
A fight between opposing players with the intention to kill. An all-in is taken either when an actor has sufficient kill pressure, either via a calculation of lethal, or as a natural consequence of prior combat.  All-ins often expend every resource and cooldown available to all champions involved.
