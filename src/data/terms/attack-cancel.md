The act of resetting a champion’s basic attack timer *before* damage occurs with a different input. If an attack is canceled, the champion will reattempt it from the beginning of their windup, rather than the moment the attack was canceled. Canceled attacks are generally considered a misinput, though intentionally canceling an attack is a strategy sometimes employed to attempt it again at a more opportune moment.
Authors’ note: Sometimes used interchangeably with attack resets, but we separated the two mechanics for increased clarity.
