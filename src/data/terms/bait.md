Baiting occurs when a player purposefully puts themselves in a dangerous position in an attempt to get the opponent to take an action. The act of baiting can be done on multiple scales. On a skirmishing level, a player can bait to try to get an opponent to start a fight, only to have their teammate(s) join once the opponents have committed to the fight. On a smaller scale, weaving in and out of the maximum range of an opponent's ability can maximize the chances of their opponent wasting a skill shot.
