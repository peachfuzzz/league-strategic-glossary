Threatening or fighting over something. An actor can contest anything: a minion, lane priority, neutral objectives, etc. Contesting is a demonstration of intent and does not necessarily mean a full fight over the object of the contest. Even just the threat of fighting, such as a soft contest, can be enough to achieve the goal of a contest.
