A threat that requires a response from the opponent. Pressure relies on an active threat: an actor with pressure threatens to take action which, if left unanswered, will create an advantage for themselves. Pressure can be applied at all three game scales. Example: a laner applies pressure to their opponent by denying minions, a splitpusher applies pressure to the map by pushing waves, and a team applies pressure to the enemy by starting a neutral objective.
