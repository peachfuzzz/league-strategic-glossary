When a wave of minions enters the opposing team’s tower range. Crashes are classified by “completeness,” determined by the location at which opposing waves meet relative to the tower. A crash is “full/complete” when the allied minions directly attack the enemy tower. A crash is considered “partial” when the enemy melee minions are in tower range, but not the ranged minions, resulting in a wave stalling just outside of tower range.

Crashes are strategically desirable because a crash and the following bounceback create a period of time in which few, if any, enemy minions die. A crash opens a window for an allied player to spend time outside of the lane—such as to roam or recall—without fear of losing excess gold and experience.
